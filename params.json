Download this repository \r\n2. Obtain API keys. Make sure the repository has access to keys. (I put my API in a secrets.sh file and ran it in my virtual env) \r\n    - [College AI API](https://api-manager.collegeai.com/)\r\n    - [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)\r\n3. Add a virtual environment to the directory (optional)\r\n    - download a virtual environment like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)\r\n    ```bash\r\n    vagrant up #activate vagrant\r\n    vagrant ssh #login to vagrant\r\n    cd src/projects/school_board # go to directory where school_board is located \r\n    virtualenv env # set up directory to have virtual env \r\n    source env/bin/activate #activate virtual environment\r\n    pip3 install -r requirements #download requirements into virtual environment\r\n    python3 server.py # launch server\r\n    ```\r\n4. If not using a virtual environment, make sure you install requirements in local environment\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    pip3 install -r requirements # download requirements into local environment \r\n    python3 server.py # launch server\r\n    ```\r\n5. After running server.py go to localhost and start using SchoolBoards!\r\n\r\n### Using SchoolBoards\r\n1.
